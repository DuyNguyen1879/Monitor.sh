This is a modified version of the shell script from NixCraft,
see the link below for details:
http://bash.cyberciti.biz/monitoring/get-system-information-in-html-format/

Notes:
 * I've modified this script to connect to multiple servers with different username 
and passwords. 
 * You may need to change the code for your custom shell.
 * Check if 'declare' is available for your shell.

TODO:
 * Take style to seperate section.
 * Remove 'declare' dependency.
 * Check shell type.
